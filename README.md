My goal for this project is to get and organize data for a [repair platform](https://fastrackfix.com) that is starting in San Francisco and needs to have a database of all possible repair shops that could enter in this platform.  First, I had to make my own dataset since I coudln't find any other that fits my purpose.  Also, I want to group shops depending on their zip code and specialties.  

### Most important conclusions
