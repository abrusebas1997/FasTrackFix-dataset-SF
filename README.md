My goal for this project is to get and organize data for a [repair platform](https://fastrackfix.com) that is starting in San Francisco and needs to have a database of all possible repair shops that could enter in this platform.  First, I had to make my own dataset since I coudln't find any other that fits my purpose.  Also, I want to group shops depending on their zip code and specialties.  

### Most important conclusions

There are more repair shops in the zip code 94103 (10 shops) than everywhere else, 94109 (7 shops), and 94108 (5 shops).

The majority of repair shops are almost new and started 4 years ago.

I grouped all type of repair shops depending on their zipcodes

### Indirect Conclusions

Some indirect conclusions we can get from this investigation are that there are more Electronic repair shops than any other type or repair shop because San Francisco is a top tech city in which most of the people use all types of electronics like: computers, phones, ipads, and other devices. And these people mostly have to go to an electronic repair shop when having problems with their devices or every once in a while for maintenance. 
Also, the neighborhood with more repair shops in the city are The Mission area and the Financial District/South Beach because these are one the most commercial areas of the city.
